# DAppSCAN
DAppSCAN: Building Large-Scale Datasets for Smart Contract Weaknesses in DApp Projects.

DAppSCAN consists of two datasets: DAppSCAN-source and DAppSCAN-bytecode.

## DAppSCAN-source

- contracts: the source of smart contracts in the DApps.

- audit_report: the original audit reports of the DApps (in pdf form).

- SWCsource(to be uploaded): the analysis report of SWCs in the source code.

## DAppSCAN-bytecode

- bytecode: the compiled bytecode of each smart contract in the DApps.

- SWCbytecode: the analysisi report of SWCs in the compiled bytecode.

- solc-DApp: the code for compiling the source code into the bytecode in this repository.
